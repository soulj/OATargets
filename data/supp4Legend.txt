Supplementary Table 4: Network based expansion of animal model OA genes	
	
Diffusion	A network diffusion algorithm was used to rank genes in a protein-protein interaction network to predict candidate OA affecting genes.	
Columns:	
Gene	The protein in the protein interaction network
AnimalModelGene	Is the gene known to have an effect in experimental models of OA? 1=yes 0=no
Number of Human Diff Exp Studies	The number of human OA transcriptomic datasets (from Supp Table 2) where this gene is differentially expressed
Number of Animal Model Diff Exp Studies	The number of human OA transcriptomic datasets (from Supp Table 2) where this gene is differentially expressed 
OA gene interactions	The number of interactions in the network this protein has with genes known to have an effect in experimental models of OA
Rank	The rank of the diffusion algorithm score for that gene in the network
OARSI Is the gene in the validation dataset of newly reported OA associated genes from the OARSI 2020 conference? 1=yes 0=no
GWAS Is the gene a candidate from OA GWAS? 1=yes 0=no
Note that NA means a protein is not present in one of the networks.
ensembl_gene_id	The ensembl ID of the gene
Anibody Tractability	Open targets antibody tractability prediction for this protein
Small molecule Tractability	Open targets small molecule tractability prediction for this protein

Validation	details of genes used for the validation of the network diffusion approach
Columns:
Gene - Gene symbol of OA associated gene
Ref - DOI of the OARSI 2020 abstract describing the gene modulation
